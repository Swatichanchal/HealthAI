# Cataract Detection
[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/fairscale/badge/?version=latest)](https://fairscale.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) [![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairscale/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

A cataract is an opacification of the lens of the eye which leads to a decrease in vision. Cataracts often develop slowly and can affect one or both eyes.When a cataract 
interferes with someone's usual activities, the cloudy lens can be replaced with a clear, artificial lens.

## Dataset 
Ocular Disease Intelligent Recognition (ODIR) is a structured ophthalmic database of 5,000 patients with age, color fundus photographs from left and right eyes and doctors' diagnostic keywords from doctors.

This dataset is meant to represent ‘‘real-life’’ set of patient information collected by Shanggong Medical Technology Co., Ltd. from different hospitals/medical centers in China.

## Prerequisites
* Python 3.4+
* PyTorch and its dependencies

## How to Install and Run
* Clone this repository and run in command prompt
```bash
pip install -r requirement.txt
``` 
* Run this to start server
```bash
python catapp.py
``` 
* Update `Retina` image and predict if user has `cataract` or not


## Train your own model*
* For traning you need to run `train.py` in src directory.
* if want to change epochs, data directory, random seed, learning rate, etc change it from `config.py`.

> Note :
> *:- This project purely utilize pytorch, it would be appriciated to use pytorch only.
