Pneumonia is the leading cause of death among young children and one of the top mortality causes worldwide. The pneumonia detection is usually performed through examine of chest X-Ray radiograph by highly trained specialists. This process is tedious and often leads to a disagreement between radiologists. Computer-aided diagnosis systems showed potential for improving the diagnostic accuracy. In this work, we develop the computational approach for pneumonia regions detection based on single-shot detectors, squeeze-and-extinction deep convolution neural networks and augmentations.

## Dataset 
The dataset is organized into 3 folders (train, test, val) and contains subfolders for each image category (Pneumonia/Normal). There are 5,863 X-Ray images (JPEG) and 2 categories (Pneumonia/Normal).

The normal chest X-ray (left panel) depicts clear lungs without any areas of abnormal opacification in the image. Bacterial pneumonia (middle) typically exhibits a focal lobar consolidation, in this case in the right upper lobe (white arrows), whereas viral pneumonia (right) manifests with a more diffuse ‘‘interstitial’’ pattern in both lungs.

## Train your own model*
* For traning you need to run `train.py` in src directory.
* if want to change epochs, data directory, random seed, learning rate, etc change it from `config.py`.

> Note :
> *:- This project purely utilize pytorch, it would be appriciated to use pytorch only.
